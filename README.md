# Deep Learning Applied in Geoinformatics Course - Final work


Repository containing the final work of the Deep Learning course. 
This repository is based on a research compendium. 
All the data is available for work replication.

All the code in this work has been created using the R SITS package in version 1.5.2. To install it, use the command

```R
install.packages("sits")
```
